# Council Quests
questL02Larva	Looking for a Larva in All the Wrong Places	The Council of Loathing wants you to bring them a mosquito larva, for some reason. They told you to look for one in the Spooky Forest, in the Distant Woods.<p>How can a woods contain a forest? Suspension of disbelief, that's how.	You delivered a mosquito larva to the Council of Loathing. Nice work!
questL03Rat	Ooh, I Think I Smell a Rat.	The owner of the Typical Tavern is having a bit of a rat infestation problem.<p>The Tavern is in the Distant Woods.	You've solved the rat problem at the Typical Tavern. Way to go!
questL04Bat	Ooh, I Think I Smell a Bat.	The Council wants you to make your way to the chamber of the Boss Bat, and slay him.<p>His chamber can be found deep within the Bat Hole, in the Nearby Plains.	You're getting closer to the Boss Bat's chamber. Keep searching the Bat Hole until you find it.	You're getting very close to the Boss Bat's chamber. Keep exploring.	You've discovered the Boss Bat's chamber -- now go in there and clean his clock. Then beat him up. Unless he doesn't have a clock, in which case just go straight to the beating.	Now that you've defeated the Boss Bat, you should go back to the Council for your reward.	You have slain the Boss Bat. Huzzah!
questL05Goblin	The Goblin Who Wouldn't Be King	The Council of Loathing wants you to infiltrate Cobb's Knob and take out the Goblin King.<p>Kill him, that is. Not, like, take him out on a date.	You have slain the Goblin King. Good job!

The Tr4pz0r wants you to find some way to protect yourself from the cold. If you can't find a way to do it magically, you can probably find some warm clothes on the eXtreme Slope of Mt. McLargeHuge.	You have learned how to hunt Yetis from the L337 Tr4pz0r. Shazam!
questL09Lol	A Quest, LOL	The Council of Loathing wants you to assist the Baron Rof L'm Fao. You must find your way past the Orc Chasm in the Big Mountains to reach the Baron's valley.	Now that you've found your way to the Valley beyond the Orc Chasm, you must make your way to the gates of the Baron's fortress.	You have helped the Baron Rof L'm Fao with his monster problem. w00t!
questL10Garbage	The Rain on the Plains is Mainly Garbage	The Council of Loathing wants you to investigate the source of the giant garbage raining down on the Nearby Plains.	You have stopped the rain of giant garbage in the Nearby Plains. Slick!
questL11MacGuffin	<Player Name> and the Quest for the Holy MacGuffin	The Council has instructed you to collect your father's archaeology notes from Distant Lands, and use them to hunt down the Holy MacGuffin. Your first step is to find the Black Market, to get some forged ID.	You've found the Black Market... now to hit the Travel Agency and get yourself on a slow boat to China. I mean, Distant Lands.	You've picked up your father's diary, and things just got a whole lot more complicated. Oh dear.	You've handed the Holy MacGuffin over to the Council, and enjoyed a ticker-tape parade in your honor. That quest was so ridiculous, it wasn't even funny, and now it's over! Hooray!
questL11Worship	Gotta Worship Them All	You father seemed to think the hidden temple in the Distant Woods might be guarding part of the Staff of Ed. I hope you've got your lucky fedora with you.	You've cunningly evaded one of the Hidden Temple's traps. But what else lies in store? cue ominous music	Having proved that you ain't no hollaback girl, there's just one more trap to go. Pity dad never got around to translating that last passage...	Awesome, you've evaded all of the temple's traps! Of course, it turned out that getting the piece of the Staff of Ed isn't going to be nearly that easy, but you were probably expecting that anyway. If you weren't, well, sorry.	You've defeated the ancient ghost of an ancient mummy of an ancient high priest and claimed his ancient amulet! Go you!
questL11Manor	In a Manor of Spooking	Your father's notes indicate that the gem from the Staff of Ed is probably hidden in a Seaside Town mansion. At a guess, you figure Spookyraven Manor is probably your best bet.	You've unlocked the wine cellar in Spookyraven Manor. What are the chances there's a secret door hidden somewhere? Yeah, probably about one in one.	You've found Lord Spookyraven's secret black magic laboratory. When you're done with him, he'll be doing black and blue magic.	You've defeated Lord Spookyraven and claimed the Eye of Ed! Huzzah!
questL11Palindome	Never Odd Or Even	If you're going to get the Staff of Fats, it looks like the first step is to get into the Palindome. Maybe it has something to do with that amulet your father mentioned in his diary? That password looks important, too.	Congratulations, you've discovered the fabulous Palindome, rumored to be the final resting place of the legendary Staff of Fats! Now all you have to do is find it...	Well, you found the Staff of Fats, but then you lost it again. Good going. Looks like you're going to have to track down this Mr. Alarm guy for help...	Mr. Alan Alarm has agreed to help you nullify Dr. Awkward's ineptitude field (patent pending), but wants some wet stew in return. Those ingredients again: lion oil, a bird rib, and some stunt nuts. Sounds delicious!	Oh yeah, you've got the Mega Gem, and are ready to deliver some pain to Dr. Awkward. They call you the bus driver, because you're gonna beat the hell out of that guy.	Congratulations, you've recovered the long-lost Staff of Fats!<p>Nice Work!
questL11Pyramid	A Pyramid Scheme	Your father's diary indicates that the key to finding the Holy MacGuffin is hidden somewhere in the desert. I hope you've got your walking shoes on.	You've managed to stumble upon a hidden oasis out in the desert. That should help make your desert explorations a little less... dry.	The fremegn leader Gnasir has tasked you with finding a stone rose, at his abandoned encampment near the oasis. Apparently it's an ancient symbol of his tribe or something, I dunno, whatever. He's not gonna help you unless you get it for him, though.	Gnasir has asked you to prove your honor and dedication to the tribe by painting his front door black. A menial task to be sure, but at least it's not dangerous.<p>Well, unless you're really allergic to paint fumes or something.	Gnasir seemed satisfied with the tasks you performed for his tribe, and has asked you to come back later.<p>...<p>Okay, that's probably long enough.	For your worm-riding training, you need to find a 'thumper', something that produces a rhythmic vibration to summon sandworms.<p>It's unlikely that we're talking about bunny rabbits here.	You need to find fifteen missing pages from Gnasir's worm-riding manual. Have fun!	One worm-riding manual page down, fourteen to go.	Two worm-riding manual pages down, thirteen to go. Sigh.	You've found all of Gnasir's missing manual pages. Time to take them back to the sietch.	You've earned your hooks and are ready to ride the worm. Literally, not in the South-of-the-Border sense.	One excitingly-described worm-ride later, you've found the little pyramid with the map of Seaside Town inside. Looks like you're going to need the Staff of Ed to get the location of the Holy MacGuffin's hiding place.	You've found the hidden buried pyramid that guards the Holy MacGuffin. You're so close you can almost taste it! (In a figurative sense, I mean -- I don't recommend you go around licking things you find in ancient tombs.)	The mighty Ed the Undying has fallen! You recovered the Holy MacGuffin! Jolly good show, mate!
questL12War	Make War, Not... Oh, Wait	The Council has gotten word of tensions building between the hippies and the frat boys on the Mysterious Island of Mystery.<p>They suspect that the two factions are about to go to war, and they want to make sure it's a big war. They want you to head down there and see if you can't stir up some trouble.	You've managed to get the war between the hippies and frat boys started, and now the Council wants you to finish it.<p>You can aid the war effort by fighting on the Battlefield, or you can help out some of the other residents of the island in the hopes that they'll aid the side you're fighting for.	You led the filthy hippies to victory in the Great War. For Gaia!	You led the Orcish frat boys to victory in the Great War. For The Horde!	You started a chain of events that led the pirates to annihilate both the hippies and the frat boys in the Great War. Toasty!
questL13Final	The Final Ultimate Epic Final Conflict	The Council of Loathing has instructed you to make your way to the top of the Naughty Sorceress' Tower and defeat her.<p>Inside the entrance to the Lair, you've encountered three strange gates. An inscription provides a clue on how you might pass through them...	Having made it through the three gates, you've encountered a giant mirror that blocks your way deeper into the Lair.	You've come to an odd junction in the cave leading to the Sorceress' Lair. It seems that in order to proceed, you'll need to solve a really convoluted and contrived puzzle involving a cloud of gas, a locked door, and three statues of mariachis.	The Council of Loathing has instructed you to make your way to the top of the Naughty Sorceress' Tower and defeat her. Currently, you're stuck in a hedge maze, Don't beat around the bush, get through it!	You've passed through the gates, solved a fiendish puzzle, beat the hedge maze like a psychotic landscaper, and now you're facing a fiendish monster on the	You've solved many puzzles, and now are confronted with the most frustrating puzzle yet. Can you figure out the code to get through the heavy door?	You're almost to the final epic showdown battle countdown of fate and destiny and whatnot! Get in there and kick some tail!	You thought you were finally going to fight the Sorceress, but you're still stuck battling her minions. This one seems to be a shadowy, evil version of you, except it doesn't have a goatee.	You find yourself fighting one of the Sorceress's freakishly overgrown familiars. What is she feeding them, anyway?	This is it, sparky -- the big showdown with the Naughty Sorceress. I just wanted to say, "good luck - we're all counting on you."	You have defeated the Naughty Sorceress! Whoohoo! You left the king in his prism, though.	You have defeated the Naughty Sorceress and freed the King! What are you hanging around here for?
